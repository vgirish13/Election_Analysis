# Election_Analysis

**Overview of Election Audit 

The purpose of this analysis is to find pertinent information hidden within the election data. We are able to use python to find the total amount of votes, total votes as a number and percentage per county, and total votes as a number and percentage per candidate. This analysis teaches students how to use many useful features within Python to perform in-depth analysis. These include creating lists and dictionaries, intializing strings and variables, creating for loops, writing repitition statements, and writing scripts that can calculate results in a percentage.

**Election- Audit Summary: 

After conducting this research, I realized that this script can be used for many different applications regarding elections. If there was more data within the excel file we could track more statistics based on the election results. For example, this script could be used to find what percentage of voters per county voted democratic, republican, or other. That would be useful for candidates in the future to decide how much campaigning is needed per county. This could be achieved through a for loop to pull the correct data from the excel sheet. Another example could be based on counties with a certain population minimum voting for a certain candidate. This could be useful to see how different candidates perform in certain sized counties.
