# Election_Analysis

**Overview of Election Audit** 

The purpose of this analysis is to find pertinent information hidden within the election data. We are able to use python to find the total amount of votes, total votes as a number and percentage per county, and total votes as a number and percentage per candidate. This is important data to understand because candidates that are well informed about previous outcomes can have a higher chance of winning. This analysis teaches students how to use many useful features within Python to perform in-depth analysis. These include creating lists and dictionaries, intializing strings and variables, creating for loops, writing repitition statements, and writing scripts that can calculate results as a percentage. 

**Election-Audit Results**

+ This election had 369,711 total votes casted

+ Jefferson county had 38,855 votes, which was 10.5% of total votes 
+ Denver county had 306,055 votes, which was 82.8% of total votes
+ Arapahoe county had 24,801 votes, which was 6.7% of total votes

+ Denver had the largest number of votes with 306,066 total votes

+ Charles Casper Stockham had a total of 85,213 votes being 23.0% of total votes
+ Diana DeGette had a total of 272,892 votes being 73.8% of total votes
+ Raymon Anthony had a total of 11,606 votes being 3.1% of total votes

+ Diana DeGette won the election by a landslide. Dianna Deggette received 272,892 votes being 73.8% of the total. 

**Election-Audit Summary** 

After conducting this research, I realized that this script can be used for many different applications regarding elections. If there was more data within the excel file we could track more statistics based on the election results. For example, this script could be used to find what percentage of voters per county voted democratic, republican, or other. That would be useful for candidates in the future to decide how much campaigning is needed per county. This could be achieved through a for loop to pull the correct data from the excel sheet. Another example could be separating counties based on a certain population minimum. This would also be achieved through a for loop with the corresponding data updated within the excel sheet. This could be useful to see how different candidates perform in certain sized counties.
